## 2026-04-05 -- v4: Embedded Agent Runtime + Wiki System

**Major architecture upgrade.** Two parallel efforts:

### Documentation Wiki
- Migrated 123 docs across 5 overlapping systems into `docs/wiki/` (27 pages)
- CLAUDE.md files slimmed to pure routing (434→163 lines)
- 22 memory files pruned, MAINTAINING.md written
- Weekly maintenance task scheduled
- ~15,000 lines of dead code removed (quoting_engine, stale strategies, legacy docs)

### Embedded Agent Runtime (Claude Code port)
- Created `cli/agent_runtime.py` — core agent architecture ported from Claude Code TypeScript
- **System prompt:** Claude Code-quality sections (doing tasks, actions, tool usage, tone)
- **Parallel tools:** READ tools execute concurrently via ThreadPoolExecutor
- **SSE streaming:** Real-time Telegram output via `editMessageText`
- **Context compaction:** Auto-summarize when approaching context window limit
- **Memory dream:** Auto-consolidate learnings after 24h + 3 sessions
- 8 new general tools: read_file, search_code, list_files, web_search, memory_read/write, edit_file, run_bash
- Agent memory system in `data/agent_memory/` (MEMORY.md index + topic files)
- Anthropic direct API with proper OpenAI→Anthropic message format conversion
- 12-iteration tool loop, 12K char results, approval gates for all writes
- Agent can read and modify its own codebase (with user approval)

### Fixes
- Anthropic tool format conversion (role="tool" → tool_result content blocks)
- Rate-limit fallback removed (Anthropic-only mode after testing)
- Default model changed to Haiku 4.5

## 2026-04-04 -- v3.2: Interactive UX + Hardening

**Phase 2.5 completed.** Major additions:
- Interactive button menu system (`/menu`, `mn:` callbacks, in-place message editing)
- Write commands: `/close`, `/sl`, `/tp` with Telegram approval flow
- Composable protection chain (4 protections, RiskGate state machine)
- HealthWindow: Passivbot-style 15-min sliding error budget, auto-downgrade on exhaustion
- Renderer ABC: TelegramRenderer + BufferRenderer, 5 commands migrated
- Signal engine: multi-timeframe confluence, exhaustion detection, RSI divergence, BB squeeze
- Daemon at tick 1728+ (WATCH tier, 120s, 19 iterators, 10 market snapshots)

**Status:** Command handlers, agent tools, and test suite all expanded significantly from v3.

## 2026-04-02 PM -- v3: Agentic Tool-Calling

**Phase 1.5 completed.** Single-day build on top of v2:
- 9 tools (7 read, 2 write with approval gates)
- Dual-mode tool calling (native + regex fallback for free models)
- Context pipeline: account state + technicals + thesis injected into every AI message
- OpenRouter integration with 18-model selector
- Centralized watchlist, candle cache with 1h freshness

**Key insight:** Rich AI context makes cheap models useful.

---

## 2026-04-02 AM -- v2: Interface-First Rewrite

**Architecture pivot.** Single morning rewrite after the oil trade loss:
- Telegram bot with rich formatting and model selector
- AI chat via OpenRouter (bypassing OpenClaw gateway)
- Per-section CLAUDE.md files for session context
- Abandoned daemon-first approach in favor of visible interface

**Key insight:** Interface-first is dramatically faster to validate than daemon-first.

---

## 2026-04-02 -- INCIDENT: Oil Trade Loss

**BRENTOIL long closed at a loss.** Every safety system failed simultaneously:

1. **Heartbeat blind 21 hours** -- `wallets.json` missing, API returning 422, zero alerting
2. **Thesis frozen 3 days** -- Last evaluation March 30, conviction stuck at 0.95 while geopolitical conditions reversed (Trump de-escalation)
3. **OpenClaw agent dead** -- auth-profiles.json had empty API keys
4. **API rate limiting** -- 9 sequential calls with no delay, 429 errors cascading to JSONDecodeError
5. **636 consecutive failures** -- No notification sent to operator

**Root cause:** Infrastructure/plumbing failures, not strategy failures. The thesis direction was correct (long oil during Hormuz crisis), but when the thesis broke down, no system warned the operator.

**Fixes applied:** Created wallets.json, lazy address resolution, 300ms API delays, 429 detection, auth profile sync, and the v2/v3 rebuild that followed.

## 2026-04-01 -- Conviction Engine Wired

- ExecutionEngine connected to heartbeat cycle
- Conviction bands: <0.3 defensive through 0.9+ maximum
- Staleness clamping: >7d tapers, >14d clamps to 0.3
- Six safeguards gating execution
- Kill switch: `conviction_bands.enabled = false`

---

## 2026-03-30 -- ThesisState + Conviction Bands

- ThesisState dataclass with load/save/staleness
- Per-market thesis files (`data/thesis/*_state.json`)
- Druckenmiller-model conviction bands for position sizing
- Exchange protection: SL at liquidation price * 1.02

---

## 2026-03 -- v1: Daemon-Centric Architecture

**Phase 1 + Phase 2 foundations:**
- 19 daemon iterators with ordered execution
- REFLECT meta-evaluation engine (CLI only)
- 4-phase master plan
- Heartbeat (2-min launchd), multi-wallet support
- 22 strategies built (only power_law_btc active)
- Quoting engine, journal engine, memory engine

**Limitation:** No user-facing interface. Failures were invisible. Led to the 21-hour blind heartbeat during the April 2 incident.

---

## Key Learnings (accumulated)

1. **Interface-first beats daemon-first.** A visible bot built in one morning caught more issues than weeks of invisible daemon work.
2. **Rich context unlocks cheap models.** 3500 tokens of live state makes free models surprisingly capable.
3. **Infrastructure fails silently.** 636 failures with zero notification. Alerting is not optional.
4. **Staleness kills.** A 3-day-old thesis at 0.95 conviction drove the system through a regime change.
5. **Each version layers, never replaces.** v1 daemon + v2 context + v3 tools + v3.2 UX = the full stack.
6. **Documentation is load-bearing.** Per-section CLAUDE.md files must stay current or AI sessions start confused.
